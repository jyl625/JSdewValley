# Background

JSdewValley is a lite clone of Stardew Valley. The original Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video where players can grow crops, raise livestock, craft goods, and engage in other activities around the town of Stardew Valley. This game, JSdewValley, will feature a simple farming simulation where players can manage their own farm and sell harvested crops to collect as much profit as possible by the end of their gameplay.

# Implementation Timeline

- **Friday Afternoon & Weekend**: Setup project. Create index.html page with canvas, and other empty webpage elements like title and nav links. Learn how to render and animate character sprites on canvas. Implement character movement. Create basic world, character, tool, and plant classes. Also on canvas, render the farm and other game objects like plants. 
- **Monday**: Implement game logic for character activity like planting, harvesting, buying seeds, selling crops. Make sure the game can progress to the next in-game day so the plants grow/wither properly. 
- **Tuesday**: Add additional plant classes. Flush out any issues from previous days.
- **Wednesday**: Finish up other features of the webpage not related to the game (i.e. nav links, etc.)
- **Thursday Morning**: Deploy on GitHub pages.
